## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key components:

- `/src`: React source code for the VirtuoAI website.
- `/components`: Reusable React components for building the user interface.
- `/pages`: Individual pages representing different sections of the website.
- `/graphql`: GraphQL queries and schema for retrieving AI-related content.
- `/styles`: Styling files using Styled Components.
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helper scripts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `/src` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
3. Set up your GraphQL server or API for AI-related content.
4. Configure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
5. Run the development server with `npm start` and start building!

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Example code snippet for querying AI-related content using GraphQL in React
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { GET_AI_RESOURCES } from './graphql/queries';

const AIResourceList = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_AI_RESOURCES);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  const aiResources = data.aiResources;

  // Render the AI resource list
  return (
    <ul>
      {aiResources.map((resource) => (
        <li key={resource.id}>{resource.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```
